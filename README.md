hi i am Simon Escobar, i am 16 years old, i new in this of programming, here i want share with you this code done in django.

the app is done in django 1.10 but you can any other version

the first is add at installed_apps:

    "INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    ...,
    'friend'
    ]"
    
the second is have users for what they been friend


    " localhost:8000/admin/"
    
    
and add users, after redirect to localhost:8000 (for default is 8000 the port, but you put any), and search so localhost:8000/"username"
